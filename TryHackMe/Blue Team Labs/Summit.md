# Objective
- After participating in one too many incident response activities, PicoSecure has decided to conduct a threat simulation and detection engineering engagement to bolster its malware detection capabilities.
- You have been assigned to work with an external penetration tester in an iterative purple-team scenario.
- The tester will be attempting to execute malware samples on a simulated internal user workstation.
- At the same time, you will need to configure PicoSecure's security tools to detect and prevent the malware from executing.
- Following the Pyramid of Pain's ascending priority of indicators, your objective is to increase the simulated adversaries' cost of operations and chase them away for good.
- Each level of the pyramid allows you to detect and prevent various indicators of attack.
